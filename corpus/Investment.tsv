1	Investment	The Zulu Principle	120	The Zulu Principle: Making Extraordinary Profits from Ordinary Shares is an investment guide written by English accountant and investor Jim Slater, first published by Orion in 1992. Slater named his approach to investment when he observed that after reading a short article on the Zulu people in the Reader's Digest his wife was better informed on the subject than he himself was. He went on to consider that if his wife read all the books she could find on the subject of Zulus, coupled with a visit to South Africa to meet them for herself, then in a relatively short period of time she could become one of the leading authorities on that "clearly defined and narrow area of knowledge".
2	Investment	Wrap account	63	A wrap account is a means of consolidating and managing an investor's investment portfolio and financial plans. Wrap fee services are offered by many financial institutions. Often wrap services are offered for a fee or a series of charges. These charges cover all administrative and management costs. This type of service is also sometimes known as an investment platform or financial platform service.
3	Investment	World Gold Council	37	The World Gold Council is the market development organisation for the gold industry. It works across all parts of the industry, from gold mining to investment, and their aim is to stimulate and sustain demand for gold.
4	Investment	With-profits policy	55	A with-profits policy (Commonwealth) or participating policy (U.S.) is an insurance contract that participates in the profits of a life insurance company. The company is often a mutual life insurance company, or had been one when it began its with-profits product line. Similar arrangements are found in other countries such as those in continental Europe.
5	Investment	Widow-and-orphan stock	86	In stock markets, a widow-and-orphan stock is one that reliably provides a regular dividend while also yielding a slow but steady rise in market value over the long term. As such, this type of stock has traditionally been an attractive investment for retirees—in some cases actually widows—as well as for professional investors managing trust funds for orphans. The term serves to denote mostly passive small investors in contrast to wealthy individuals and professional investors who tend to play a more active role and seek greater returns.
6	Investment	Wall crossing	97	Wall crossing is a technique used by publicly traded companies to raise capital, typically from institutional investors in two stages. In a wall crossing, a publicly listed company tries to raise capital through large stock sales by having institutional investors pre-arranged to buy substantial blocks of newly issued stock ahead of a public announcement of the offering as part of a confidential offering. In order to participate in what is essentially a private placement, investors typically sign a non-disclosure agreement that allows them to "cross the wall", thus becoming insiders and gaining access to material non-public information.
7	Investment	Vulture investor	96	Unlike an angel investor, a vulture investor buys up assets and financial instruments below cost from distressed entities. This could take the form of securities, debt, held assets, real estate, etc. A vulture investor may purchase the controlling shares of a company in order to liquidate, thereby realizing a higher yield return on investment than the original purchase price. Real estate could be purchased from a borrower who is no longer able to make payments on their loan and needs to sell the property in order to improve their balance sheet or retain their credit rating.
8	Investment	Vulture capitalist	8	Vulture capitalists are investors that acquire distressed assets.
9	Investment	VISTA (economics)	11	VISTA is an acronym for Vietnam, Indonesia, South Africa, Turkey, Argentina.
10	Investment	Value premium	64	In investing, value premium refers to the greater risk-adjusted return of value stocks over growth stocks. Eugene Fama and K. G. French first identified the premium in 1992, using a measure they called HML to measure equity returns based on valuation. Other experts, such as John C. Bogle, have argued that no value premium exists, claiming that Fama and French's research is period dependent.
11	Investment	Value investing	53	Value investing is an investment paradigm that involves buying securities that appear underpriced by some form of fundamental analysis. The various forms of value investing derive from the investment philosophy first taught by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd at Columbia Business School in 1928, and subsequently developed in their 1934 text Security Analysis.
12	Investment	Value averaging	165	Value averaging (VA), also known as dollar value averaging (DVA), is a technique for adding to an investment portfolio that is controversially claimed to provide a greater return than other methods such as dollar cost averaging. With the method, investors add to their portfolios in such a way that the portfolio balance reaches a predetermined monthly or quarterly target, regardless of market fluctuations. For example, an investor may want to have a $3600 investment in 36 months. Using VA, the investor would aim to have a total investment value of $100 at the beginning of the first month, $200 at the beginning of the second month, and so on. Having invested $100 at the beginning of the first month, the investment may be worth $101 at the end of that month. In that case, the investor invests a further $99 to reach the second month objective of $200. If at the end of the first month, the investment is worth $205, the investor withdraws $5.
13	Investment	Unified managed account	112	Unified managed accounts are managed investment accounts that have developed out of separate accounts. Where a separate account holds the securities associated with a single investment manager or style managed for a client, a unified managed account typically holds multiple separate accounts, as well as other investment products such as mutual funds and exchange traded funds. Unified managed accounts also typically automate services such as rebalancing, cashflow management, and other services that are typically handled manually by financial advisors or institutions when using a separate account. A unified managed account removes the need to have more than one account and combines all of the assets into one account with a single registration.
14	Investment	Unicorn bubble	55	A unicorn bubble is a theoretical economic bubble that would occur when unicorn startup companies are overvalued by venture capitalists or investors. This can either occur during the private phase of these unicorn companies, or in an initial public offering. A unicorn company being one which is valued at, or above, $1 billion US dollars.
15	Investment	Undervalued stock	50	An undervalued stock is defined as a stock that is selling at a price significantly below what is assumed to be its intrinsic value. For example, if a stock is selling for $50, but it is worth $100 based on predictable future cash flows, then it is an undervalued stock.
16	Investment	Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive 2009	53	The Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive (UCITS) 2009/65/EC is a consolidated EU Directive, that allows collective investment schemes to operate freely throughout the EU on the basis of a single authorisation from one member state. EU member states are entitled to have additional regulatory requirements for the benefit of investors.
17	Investment	Undercapitalization	65	Under-capitalization refers to any situation where a business cannot acquire the funds they need. An under-capitalized business may be one that cannot afford current operational expenses due to a lack of capital, which can trigger bankruptcy, may be one that is over-exposed to risk, or may be one that is financially sound but does not have the funds required to expand to meet market demand.
18	Investment	Uncompensated risk	29	In investments, uncompensated risk is the level of additional risk for which no additional returns are generated and when taking systematic withdrawals make the probability of failure unacceptably high.
19	Investment	Turnaround stock	15	A turnaround stock is a share with a high P/E ratio but low price-to-book ratio.
20	Investment	Time-weighted return	50	The time-weighted return (TWR) is a method of calculating investment return. To apply the time-weighted return method, combine the returns over sub-periods, by compounding them together, resulting in the overall period return. The rate of return over each different sub-period is weighted according to the duration of the sub-period.
21	Investment	Trillion dollar club (economics)	32	The Trillion dollar club is an unofficial classification of the world's major economies with a gross domestic product of more than US$1 trillion per year. As of 2017, it included 16 countries.
22	Investment	Traditional investments	33	In finance, the notion of traditional investments refers to putting money into well-known assets with the expectation of capital appreciation, dividends, and interest earnings. Traditional investments are to be contrasted with alternative investments.
23	Investment	Trade in services statistics	63	Trade in services statistics are economic statistics which detail international trade in services. They received a great deal of focus at the advent of services negotiations which took place under the Uruguay Round, which became part of the General Agreement on Trade in Services, one of the four principal pillars of the World Trade Organization (WTO) trade treaty, also called the "WTO Agreement".
24	Investment	Trade idea	119	Trade ideas are investment ideas, typically equity related, which are sent by institutional stockbrokers to their institutional clients. They typically propose a trade in a specific stock and are developed by the individual idea author’s own knowledge of their client’s particular area of investment interest, so will take into account: the client’s investment style, portfolio size and the sector and geographic focus. Recipients of trade ideas can be hedge funds, bank’s proprietary trading desks and money managers. Trade ideas are sent to the client with a recommendation to buy or sell, an investment value and often a timeframe and an indication of level of conviction. The most active consumers of Trade Ideas are funds using quantitative or systematic strategies.
25	Investment	Tontine	77	A tontine is an investment plan for raising capital, devised in the 17th century and relatively widespread in the 18th and 19th centuries. It combines features of a group annuity and a lottery. Each subscriber pays an agreed sum into the fund, and thereafter receives an annuity. As members die, their shares devolve to the other participants, and so the value of each annuity increases. On the death of the last member, the scheme is wound up.
26	Investment	Time to value	97	Time to value (TTV) is similar to return on investment (ROI), but instead of realizing the financial success of an investment, it implies achieving the effectiveness of an investment. This is applied mostly to added technology — data center hardware, network infrastructure, system security, etc. whereby the promised improvement becomes measurable. It can even be argued that in cases such as data security, TTV is more important than ROI since the security may only have financial benefits in banking and commercial industries, but has value — the protection of personal and/or corporate data — in every industry.
27	Investment	Thematic investing	27	Thematic investing is a form of investment which aims to identify macro-level trends, and the underlying investments that stand to benefit from the materialisation of those trends.
28	Investment	The Craftory	41	The Craftory is a global investment house based in London, UK. It was founded in early 2018 as an alternative to Venture Capital. The current fund size is $375 million in permanent capital and the firm only invests in ‘Challenger Brands’.
29	Investment	Term (time)	40	A term is a period of duration, time or occurrence, in relation to an event. To differentiate an interval or duration, common phrases are used to distinguish the observance of length are near-term or short-term, medium-term or mid-term and long-term.
30	Investment	Tear sheet	91	In advertising, a tear sheet is a page cut or torn from a publication to prove to the client that the advertisement was published. Media buying agencies are often required by clients to provide tear sheets along with a post analysis of any advertising campaign. With the emergence of online advertising tear sheets often now appear in the form of a PDF file, known as a "virtual tear sheet", or "electronic tear sheet". Tear sheets are also used by writers and photographers as proof that their article or photo was published.
31	Investment	Taxation of precious metals	40	Precious metals are subject to taxation in most countries, because of their high economic value. In most countries capital gains tax applies when precious metals are sold at a profit. Some countries also apply value added tax to precious metals.
32	Investment	Tangible investment	39	A tangible investment is something physical that you can touch. It is an investment in a tangible, hard or real asset or personal property. This contrasts with financial investments such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other financial instruments.
33	Investment	Tail risk parity	78	Tail risk parity is an extension of the risk parity concept that takes into account the behavior of the portfolio components during tail risk events. The goal of the tail risk parity approach is to protect investment portfolios at the times of economic crises and reduce the cost of such protection during normal market conditions. In the tail risk parity framework risk is defined as expected tail loss. The tail risk parity concept is similar to drawdown parity
34	Investment	T-model	115	In finance, the T-model is a formula that states the returns earned by holders of a company's stock in terms of accounting variables obtainable from its financial statements. The T-model connects fundamentals with investment return, allowing an analyst to make projections of financial performance and turn those projections into a required return that can be used in investment selection. Mathematically the model is as follows:where  = total return from the stock over a period ; = the growth rate of the company's book value during the period; = the ratio of price / book value at the beginning of the period. = the company's return on equity, i.e. earnings during the period / book value;
35	Investment	Style investing	53	Style investing is an investment approach in which rotation among different "styles" is supposed to be important for successful investing. As opposed to investing in individual securities, style investors can decide to make portfolio allocation decisions by placing their money in broad categories of assets, such as "large-cap", "growth", "international", or "emerging markets".
36	Investment	Stranger-originated life insurance	190	Stranger-originated life insurance ("STOLI") generally means any act, practice, or arrangement, at or prior to policy issuance, to initiate or facilitate the issuance of a life insurance policy for the intended benefit of a person who, at the time of policy origination, does not have an insurable interest in the life of the insured under the laws of the applicable state. This includes the purchase of life insurance with resources or guarantees from or through a person that, at the time of policy initiation, could not lawfully initiate the policy; an arrangement or other agreement to transfer ownership of the policy or the policy benefits to another person; or a trust or similar arrangement that is used directly or indirectly for the purpose of purchasing one or more policies for the intended benefit of another person in a manner that violates the insurable interest laws of the state. The main characteristic of a STOLI transaction is that the insurance is purchased solely as an investment vehicle, rather than for the benefit of the policy owner's beneficiaries. STOLI arrangements are typically promoted to consumers between the age of 65 and 85.

Examples of professional designations held by individuals in this field, which affects the types of investments they are permitted to sell and the services they provide include chartered financial consultants, certified financial planners or chartered financial analysts, chartered strategic wealth professionals, chartered financial planners, and Master of Business Administration. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority provides an online tool designed to help understand professional designations in the United States.
38	Investment	Statistical arbitrage	40	In finance, statistical arbitrage is a class of short-term financial trading strategies that employ mean reversion models involving broadly diversified portfolios of securities held for short periods of time. These strategies are supported by substantial mathematical, computational, and trading platforms.
39	Investment	Stabilization clause	12	A stabilization clause is a risk management device used in investment contracts.
40	Investment	Split share corporation	162	A split share corporation is a corporation that exists for a defined period of time to transform the risk and investment return of a basket of shares of conventional dividend-paying corporations into the risk and return of the two or more classes of publicly traded shares in the split share corporation. Most commonly a split share corporation issues equal numbers of shares from a class of preferred shares and a class of capital or class A shares. The proceeds of the share offering are invested in conventional dividend-paying shares according to the regulations of the split share corporation. The preferred shares typically offer relatively high and secure dividend yield at a fixed coupon rate but with no expectation of capital gain by the time that the split share corporation is wound up. The capital shares often pay a dividend like the preferred shares; in addition, the capital shares offer participation in the leveraged capital gains of the underlying basket of conventional shares.
41	Investment	Split capital investment trust	57	A split capital investment trust (split) is a type of investment trust which issues different classes of share to give the investor a choice of shares to match their needs. Most splits have a limited life determined at launch known as the wind-up date. Typically the life of a split capital trust is five to ten years.
42	Investment	Special settlement	46	Special settlements in the securities markets exist for OTC trades. It allows a settlement day to be chosen at the time of trading which is outside of the market norms. This is often used to allow financing of short term positions outside of the traders ability.
43	Investment	Smart beta	30	Smart beta investment portfolios offer the benefits of passive strategies combined with some of the advantages of active ones, placing it at the intersection of efficient-market hypothesis and factor investing.
44	Investment	Skewness risk	56	Skewness risk in financial modeling is the risk that results when observations are not spread symmetrically around an average value, but instead have a skewed distribution. As a result, the mean and the median can be different. Skewness risk can arise in any quantitative model that assumes a symmetric distribution but is applied to skewed data.
45	Investment	Single deposit	41	Single deposit is one-time lump sum investment. The Investment is made at the start of the period; grows over the period and matures at the end of the period. Examples of a single deposit are certificates of deposit or Fixed Deposits.
46	Investment	Simple Dietz method	34	The simple Dietz method is a means of measuring historical investment portfolio performance, compensating for external flows into/out of the portfolio during the period. The formula for the simple Dietz return is as follows:
47	Investment	Simple agreement for future equity (SAFE)	76	A SAFE  is an agreement between an investor and a company that provides rights to the investor for future equity in the company similar to a warrant, except without determining a specific price per share at the time of the initial investment. The SAFE investor receives the futures shares when a priced round of investment or liquidation event occurs. SAFEs are intended to provide a simpler mechanism for startups to seek initial funding than convertible notes.
48	Investment	Shipping investments	38	Shipping investments are a form of alternative investment into an asset related to worldwide shipping. This could be into ships themselves, or a related asset such as containers, with the expectation of capital appreciation, dividends, and/or interest earnings.

SIP's are an HMRC approved, tax efficient all employee plan, which provides companies with the flexibility to tailor the plan to meet their business needs. SIPs are becoming increasingly popular with companies that want to engage their workforce and recruit and retain key employees. From 6 April 2014, HMRC approval will no longer be required for a SIP to obtain tax benefits, instead an employer is required to self-certify that the SIP meets the requirements of the relevant legislation. Accordingly, from 6 April 2014, a SIP should no longer be referred to as an HMRC approved plan.
50	Investment	Self-invested personal pension	40	A self-invested personal pension (SIPP) is the name given to the type of UK government-approved personal pension scheme, which allows individuals to make their own investment decisions from the full range of investments approved by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).
51	Investment	Security market line	65	Security market line (SML) is the representation of the capital asset pricing model. It displays the expected rate of return of an individual security as a function of systematic, non-diversifiable risk. The risk of an individual risky security reflects the volatility of the return from security rather than the return of the market portfolio. The risk in these individual risky securities reflects the systematic risk.
52	Investment	Security characteristic line	75	Security characteristic line (SCL) is a regression line, plotting performance of a particular security or portfolio against that of the market portfolio at every point in time. The SCL is plotted on a graph where the Y-axis is the excess return on a security over the risk-free return and the X-axis is the excess return of the market in general. The slope of the SCL is the security's beta, and the intercept is its alpha.
53	Investment	Investment Securities	34	Investment Securities are securities that have been purchased as an investment. This is in contrast to securities that are purchased by a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary for resale or short term speculation.

57	Investment	Rolling (finance)	32	Rolling a contract is an investment concept meaning trading out of a standard contract and then buying the contract with next longest maturity, so as to maintain a position with constant maturity.
58	Investment	Risk–return spectrum	35	The risk–return spectrum is the relationship between the amount of return gained on an investment and the amount of risk undertaken in that investment. The more return sought, the more risk that must be undertaken.
59	Investment	Risk parity	62	Risk parity is an approach to investment portfolio management which focuses on allocation of risk, usually defined as volatility, rather than allocation of capital. The risk parity approach asserts that when asset allocations are adjusted to the same risk level, the risk parity portfolio can achieve a higher Sharpe ratio and can be more resistant to market downturns than the traditional portfolio.
60	Investment	Rights of accumulation	36	The Right of Accumulation is an investment term for mutual fund transactions, that allows an investor to get lower sales charges on multiple transactions, instead of requiring a single transaction to be over a given amount.
61	Investment	Revolving Loan Fund	117	A Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) is a source of money from which loans are made for multiple small business development projects. Revolving loan funds share many characteristics with microcredit, micro-enterprise, and village banking, namely providing loans to persons or groups of people that do not qualify for traditional financial services or are otherwise viewed as being high risk. Borrowers tend to be small producers of goods and services: typically, they are artisans, farmers, and women with no credit history or access to other types of loans from financial institutions. Organizations that offer revolving loan fund lending aim to help new project or business owners become financially independent and eventually to become eligible for loans from commercial banks.
62	Investment	Reverse convertible securities	117	A reverse convertible security or convertible security is a short-term note linked to an underlying stock. The security offers a steady stream of income due to the payment of a high coupon rate. In addition, at maturity the owner will receive either 100% of the par value or, if the stock value falls, a predetermined number of shares of the underlying stock. In the context of structured product, a reverse convertible can be linked to an equity index or a basket of indices. In such case, the capital repayment at maturity is cash settled, either 100% of principal, or less if the underlying index falls conditional on barrier is hit in the case of barrier reverse convertibles.
63	Investment	Return on investment	62	Return on investment (ROI) is a ratio between net profit and cost of investment. A high ROI means the investment's gains compare favorably to its cost. As a performance measure, ROI is used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment or to compare the efficiencies of several different investments. In economic terms, it is one way of relating profits to capital invested.
64	Investment	Retirement spend-down	59	At retirement, individuals stop working and no longer get employment earnings, and enter a phase of their lives, where they rely on the assets they have accumulated, to supply money for their spending needs for the rest of their lives. Retirement spend-down, or withdrawal rate, is the strategy a retiree follows to spend, decumulate or withdraw assets during retirement.
65	Investment	Resampled efficient frontier	261	In investment portfolio construction, an investor or analyst is faced with determining which asset classes, such as domestic fixed income, domestic equity, foreign fixed income, and foreign equity, to invest in and what proportion of the total portfolio should be of each asset class. Harry Markowitz (1959) first described a method for constructing a portfolio with optimal risk/return characteristics. His portfolio optimization method finds the minimum risk portfolio with a given expected return. Because the Markowitz or Mean-Variance Efficient Portfolio is calculated from the sample mean and covariance, which are likely different from the population mean and covariance, the resulting investment portfolio may allocate too much weight to assets with better estimated than true risk/return characteristics. To account for the uncertainty of the sample estimates, a financial analyst can create many alternative efficient frontiers based on resampled versions of the data. Each resampled dataset will result in a different set of Markowitz efficient portfolios. These efficient frontiers of portfolios can then be averaged to create a resampled efficient frontier. The appropriate compromise between the investor's Risk aversion and desired return will then guide the financial analyst to choose a portfolio from the set of resampled efficient frontier portfolios. Since such a portfolio is different from the Markowitz efficient portfolio it will have suboptimal risk/return characteristics with respect to the sample mean and covariance, but optimal characteristics when averaged over the many possible values of the unknown true mean and covariance. Resampled Efficiency is covered by U. S. patent #6,003,018, patent pending worldwide. New Frontier Advisors, LLC, has exclusive worldwide licensing rights.
66	Investment	Relative return	21	Relative return is a measure of the return of an investment portfolio relative to a theoretical passive reference portfolio or benchmark.
67	Investment	Rebalancing investments	85	The rebalancing of investments is the action / trading strategy of bringing a portfolio that has deviated away from one's target asset allocation back into line. This can be implemented by transferring assets, that is, selling investments of an asset class that is overweight and using the money to buy investments in a class that is underweight, but it also applies to adding or removing money from a portfolio, that is, putting new money into an underweight class, or making withdrawals from an overweight class.
68	Investment	Real assets	48	Real Assets is an investment asset class that covers investments in physical assets such as real estate, energy, and infrastructure. Real assets have an inherent physical worth. Real assets differ from financial assets in that financial assets get their value from a contractual right and are typically intangible.
69	Investment	Rate of return on a portfolio	38	The rate of return on a portfolio is the ratio of the net gain or loss which a portfolio generates, relative to the size of the portfolio. It is measured over a period of time, commonly a year.
70	Investment	Rate of return	59	In finance, return is a profit on an investment. It comprises any change in value of the investment, and/or cash flows which the investor receives from the investment, such as interest payments or dividends. It may be measured either in absolute terms or as a percentage of the amount invested. The latter is also called the holding period return.
71	Investment	Range accrual	81	In finance, a range accrual is a type of derivative product very popular among structured note investors. It is estimated that more than US$160 billion of Range Accrual indexed on interest rates only have been sold to investors between 2004 and 2007. It is one of the most popular non-vanilla financial derivatives. In essence the investor in a range accrual is "betting" that the reference "index" - usually interest rates or currency exchange rates - will stay within a predefined range.
72	Investment	Quantitative value investing	58	Quantitative value investing, also known as systematic value investing, is a form of value investing that analyzes fundamental data such as financial statement line items, economic data, and unstructured data in a rigorous and systematic manner. Practitioners often employ quantitative applications such as statistical / empirical finance or mathematical finance, behavioral finance, natural language processing, and machine learning.
73	Investment	Quantitative fund	21	A quantitative fund is an investment fund in which investment decisions are determined by numerical methods rather than by human judgment.
74	Investment	Quality investing	44	Quality investing is an investment strategy based on a set of clearly defined fundamental criteria that seeks to identify companies with outstanding quality characteristics. The quality assessment is made based on soft and hard criteria. Quality investing supports best overall rather than best-in-class approach.
75	Investment	Qirad	64	The qirad was one of the basic financial instruments of the medieval Islamic world. It was an arrangement between one or more investors and an agent where the investors entrusted capital to an agent who then traded with it in hopes of making profit.

76	Investment	Pyramid trading	53	Pyramid trading, also known as pyramiding, is a trading strategy which consists of adding to an existing trade or position as the price moves in the expected direction. Doing so reduces the risk levels of an investment, with traders using small increments to increase their holdings rather than betting big from the start.
77	Investment	Psychology of previous investment	52	The "psychology of previous investment" was coined by James Howard Kunstler to describe the sunk costs of the modern urban/suburban lifestyle. It is the reluctance to abandon technologies and standards of urban infrastructure into which humans have already made substantial investments, and is seen as a major contributor to modern energy crises.
78	Investment	Property investment calculator	64	Property investment calculator is a term used to define an application that provides fundamental financial analysis underpinning the purchase, ownership, management, rental and/or sale of real estate for profit.

84	Investment	Principal protected note	25	A Principal protected note (PPN) is an investment contract with a guaranteed rate of return of at least the amount invested, and a possible gain.
85	Investment	Price return	62	The price return is the rate of return on an investment portfolio, where the return measure takes into account only the capital appreciation of the portfolio, while the income generated by the assets in the portfolio, in the form of interest and dividends, is ignored. This contrasts with the total return, which does take into account the income generated in the portfolio.
86	Investment	Power reverse dual-currency note	156	A dual-currency note (DC) pays coupons in the investor's domestic currency with the notional in the issuer's domestic currency. A reverse dual-currency note (RDC) is a note which pays a foreign interest rate in the investor's domestic currency. A power reverse dual-currency note (PRDC) is a structured product where an investor is seeking a better return and a borrower a lower rate by taking advantage of the interest rate differential between two economies. The power component of the name denotes higher initial coupons and the fact that coupons rise as the foreign exchange rate depreciates. The power feature comes with a higher risk for the investor, which characterizes the product as leveraged carry trade.

The technique was pioneered by Hayne Leland and Mark Rubinstein in 1976. Since its inception, the portfolio insurance strategy has been dubiously marketed as a product. However, this is a misnomer as it is not a policy and there is no insurer of last resort.

98	Investment	Pensions crisis	112	The pensions crisis or pensions timebomb is the predicted difficulty in paying for corporate or government employment retirement pensions in various countries, due to a difference between pension obligations and the resources set aside to fund them. The basic difficulty of the pension problem is that institutions must be sustained over far longer than the political planning horizon. Shifting demographics are causing a lower ratio of workers per retiree; contributing factors include retirees living longer, and lower birth rates. An international comparison of pension institution by countries is important to solve the pension crisis problem. There is significant debate regarding the magnitude and importance of the problem, as well as the solutions.
99	Investment	Payback period	111	Payback period in capital budgeting refers to the time required to recoup the funds expended in an investment, or to reach the break-even point. For example, a $1000 investment made at the start of year 1 which returned $500 at the end of year 1 and year 2 respectively would have a two-year payback period. Payback period is usually expressed in years. Starting from investment year by calculating Net Cash Flow for each year: Net Cash Flow Year 1 = Cash Inflow Year 1 - Cash Outflow Year 1. Then Cumulative Cash Flow = Accumulate by year until Cumulative Cash Flow is a positive number: that year is the payback year.

112	Investment	Negative gearing	133	Negative gearing is a form of financial leverage whereby an investor borrows money to acquire an income-producing investment and the gross income generated by the investment is less than the cost of owning and managing the investment, including depreciation and interest charged on the loan. The investor may enter into a negatively geared investment expecting tax benefits or the capital gain on the investment after it is sold to exceed the accumulated losses of holding the investment. The investor would take into account the tax treatment of negative gearing, which may generate additional benefits to the investor in the form of tax benefits if the loss on a negatively geared investment is tax-deductible against the investor's other taxable income and if the capital gain on the sale is given a favourable tax treatment.

The idea is to help the start-up companies increase their metrics in a very short period of time; this way, instead of spending money on online marketing, they can use their financial resources to improve other aspects of their businesses. The companies receive advertising space instead of cash for their stock.

132	Investment	Malinvestment	96	In Austrian business cycle theory, malinvestments are badly allocated business investments, due to artificially low cost of credit and an unsustainable increase in money supply. Central banks are often blamed for causing malinvestments, such as the dot-com bubble and the United States housing bubble. Austrian economists such as the Swedish central bank's Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences laureate F. A. Hayek advocate the idea that malinvestment occurs due to the combination of fractional reserve banking and artificially low interest rates misleading relative price signals which eventually necessitate a corrective contraction—a boom followed by a bust.
133	Investment	Low-volatility investing	74	Low-volatility investing is an investment style that buys securities with low volatility and avoids securities with high volatility. This investment style exploits the low-volatility anomaly. According to financial theory risk and return should be positively related, however in practice this is not true.

However, the live auction method differentiates itself with the human interaction and expert judgment of the specialists, which are currently seen as obsolete since most customers seem to prefer speed, and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is working to redefine the role played by the specialists in the market. The NYSE is seen as the world's premier example of a hybrid market.

Its goal is to guide entities, private or public, that are confronted with the fundamental problem of economics.This fundamental problem of economics consists of two fundamental questions that must be answered, namely what objectives should be investigated or explored and how should these be achieved? Economics as a social science answers those questions and is defined as the knowledge used for selecting among “…technically feasible alternatives for the purpose of a rational allocation of scarce resources.” Correspondingly, all problems involving "...profit maximizing or cost-minimizing are engineering problems with economic objectivesand are properly described by the label "engineering economy".
207	Investment	Employee stock purchase plan	93	In the United States, an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) is a tax-efficient means by which employees of a corporation can purchase the corporation's stock, often at a discount.

This includes markets that may become developed markets in the future or were in the past. The term "frontier market" is used for developing countries with smaller, riskier, or more illiquid capital markets than "emerging". The economies of China and India are considered to be the largest emerging markets. According to The Economist, many people find the term outdated, but no new term has gained traction.

211	Investment	Double bottom line	106	Double bottom line seeks to extend the conventional bottom line, that measures fiscal performance—financial profit or loss—by adding a second bottom line to measure their performance in terms of positive social impact. There is controversy about how to measure the double bottom line, especially since the use of the term "bottom line" implies some form of quantification. A 2004 report by the Center for Responsible Business noted that while there are "generally accepted principles of accounting" for financial returns, "A comparable standard for social impact accounting does not yet exist." Social return on investment has been suggested as a way to quantify the second bottom line.
212	Investment	Domain Developers Fund	67	Domain Developers Fund (DDF) is the first public open-ended alternative investment fund exclusively invested in Internet domain names. DDF maintains an inventory of websites and domain names, including a wide variety of gTLD and ccTLD domains, from which it extracts advertising revenue through a combination of pay per click advertising, affiliate marketing and domain parking. Internet domains are perceived as an alternate asset class for investment diversification.

Dollar cost averaging is also called the constant dollar plan, pound-cost averaging, and, irrespective of currency, unit cost averaging, incremental trading, or the cost average effect.
214	Investment	Dogs of the Dow	86	The Dogs of the Dow is an investment strategy popularized by Michael B. O'Higgins in 1991 and the official Dogs of the Dow website, which proposes that an investor annually select for investment the ten Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) stocks whose dividend is the highest fraction of their price.

Under this type of plan, the employee contributes a predetermined portion of his or her earnings to an individual account, all or part of which is matched by the employer.
223	Investment	Cost of delay	51	Cost of Delay is "a way of communicating the impact of time on the outcomes we hope to achieve". More formally, it is the partial derivative of the total expected value with respect to time. Cost of Delay combines an understanding of value with how that value leaks away over time.

225	Investment	Convention of conservatism	80	In accounting, the convention of conservatism, also known as the doctrine of prudence, is a policy of anticipating possible future losses but not future gains. This policy tends to understate rather than overstate net assets and net income, and therefore lead companies to "play safe". When given a choice between several outcomes where the probabilities of occurrence are equally likely, you should recognize that transaction resulting in the lower amount of profit, or at least the deferral of a profit..
226	Investment	Contrarian investing	22	Contrarian Investing is an investment strategy that is characterized by purchasing and selling in contrast to the prevailing sentiment of the time.
227	Investment	Constant proportion portfolio insurance	74	Constant proportion portfolio investment (CPPI) is a trading strategy that allows an investor to maintain an exposure to the upside potential of a risky asset while providing a capital guarantee against downside risk. The outcome of the CPPI strategy is somewhat similar to that of buying a call option, but does not use option contracts. Thus CPPI is sometimes referred to as a convex strategy, as opposed to a "concave strategy" like constant mix.
228	Investment	Constant dollar plan	60	The constant ratio plan was one of the first plans devised when institutions started to invest in the stock market. The plan is often called rebalancing. Another type of plan is called a "variable ratio plan". There are several ways of executing these plans.

232	Investment	Circle of competence	100	A circle of competence is the subject area which matches a person's skills or expertise. The mental model was developed by Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger to describe limiting one's financial investments in areas where an individual may have limited understanding or experience, concentrating in areas where one has the greatest familiarity, and to emphasize the importance of aligning a subjective assessment of one own's competence with actual competence. Buffett summarized the concept in the motto, "Know your circle of competence, and stick within it. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital."
233	Investment	Churning (finance)	60	Churning is the practice of executing trades for an investment account by a salesman or broker in order to generate commission from the account.

238	Investment	Capital participation	81	Capital participation is a form of equity sharing not restricted to housing, in which a company, infrastructure, property or business is shared between different parties. Shareholders invest in a business for profit maximization and cost savings, e.g. through tax deduction. A visible and controversial form of capital participation can be found in public-private partnerships in which the private sector invests in public projects and usually receive a time-limited concession for ownership or operation to make profits from the acquired property.
239	Investment	Capital market line	53	Capital market line (CML) is the tangent line drawn from the point of the risk-free asset to the feasible region for risky assets. The tangency point M represents the market portfolio, so named since all rational investors should hold their risky assets in the same proportions as their weights in the market portfolio.
240	Investment	Capital budgeting	77	Capital budgeting, and investment appraisal, is the planning process used to determine whether an organization's long term investments such as new machinery, replacement of machinery, new plants, new products, and research development projects are worth the funding of cash through the firm's capitalization structure. It is the process of allocating resources for major capital, or investment, expenditures. One of the primary goals of capital budgeting investments is to increase the value of the firm to the shareholders.
241	Investment	Buy-write	44	The term buy-write is used to describe an investment strategy in which the investor buys stocks and writes call options against the stock position. The writing of the call option provides extra income for an investor who is willing to forgo some upside potential.

243	Investment	Business broker	68	Business brokers, also called business transfer agents, or intermediaries, assist buyers and sellers of privately held businesses in the buying and selling process. They typically estimate the value of the business; advertise it for sale with or without disclosing its identity; handle the initial potential buyer interviews, discussions, and negotiations with prospective buyers; facilitate the progress of the due diligence investigation and generally assist with the business sale.
244	Investment	Bull (stock market speculator)	243	A bull is a stock market speculator who buys a holding in a stock in the expectation that in the very short-term it will rise in value whereupon they will sell the stock to make a quick profit on the transaction. Strictly speaking the term applies to speculators who borrow money to fund such a purchase, and are thus under great pressure to complete the transaction before the loan is repayable or the seller of the stock demands payment on settlement day for delivery of the bargain. If the value of the stock falls contrary to their expectation, a bull suffers a loss, frequently very large if they are trading on margin. A bull has a great incentive to "talk-up" the value of their stock or to manipulate the market in their stock, for example by spreading false rumour, to procure a buyer or to cause a temporary price increase which will provide them with the selling opportunity and profit they require. A bull must therefore be contrasted with an investor, who purchases a stock in expectation of a medium-term or long-term increase in value due to the underlying performance of the company and its assets. The speculator who takes a directly opposite view to the bull is the bear, who speculates on a stock decreasing in value, having sold short. A bull market is a period during which stock market prices rise over a sustained period, therefore to the advantage of bulls.
245	Investment	Bond credit rating	47	In investment, the bond credit rating represents the credit worthiness of corporate or government bonds. It is not the same as an individual's credit score.

Blended finance offers the possibility to scale up commercial financing for developing countries and to channel such financing toward investments with development impact. As such, blended finance is designed to support progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set forth by the United Nations. Meeting the SDGs will require an additional $2.5 trillion in private and public financing per year as of 2017 estimates, and an additional $13.5 trillion to implement the COP21 Paris climate accord. The concept of blended finance can contribute to raising the private financing needed. It was first recognized as a solution to the funding gap in the outcome document of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development in July 2015.
247	Investment	Black–Litterman model	75	In finance, the Black–Litterman model is a mathematical model for portfolio allocation developed in 1990 at Goldman Sachs by Fischer Black and Robert Litterman, and published in 1992.

Typical assets are financial instruments such as bonds, shares, and their derivatives, as well as real estate and other capital goods. Although the values of such assets are often casually said to "inflate," this should not be confused with inflation as a defined term. A more accurate description for an increase in the value of a capital asset is appreciation.
253	Investment	Asset location	40	Asset location (AL) is a term used in personal finance to refer to how investors distribute their investments across savings vehicles including taxable accounts, tax-exempt accounts, tax-deferred accounts, trust accounts, variable life insurance policies, foundations, and onshore vs. offshore accounts.

The process is characterized by an on-going review, modification, and revision of asset and liability management strategies so that sensitivity to interest rate changes are confined within acceptable tolerance levels. There are different models used and some use different elements, according to specific needs and contexts. For instance, an individual or an organization may keep parts of the ALM process and outsource the modeling function or adapt the model according to the requirements and capabilities of relevant institutions such as banks, which often have their in-house modeling process. For pensioners, asset/liability modeling is all about determining the best allocation for specific situations. There is a vast array of models available today for practical asset and liability modeling and these have been the subject of several research and studies.
255	Investment	Asset classes	94	In finance, an asset class is a group of financial instruments which have similar financial characteristics and behave similarly in the marketplace. We can often break these instruments into those having to do with real assets and those having to do with financial assets. Often, assets within the same asset class are subject to the same laws and regulations; however, this is not always true. For instance, futures on an asset are often considered part of the same asset class as the underlying instrument but are subject to different regulations than the underlying instrument.
256	Investment	Asian option	101	An Asian option is a special type of option contract. For Asian options the payoff is determined by the average underlying price over some pre-set period of time. This is different from the case of the usual European option and American option, where the payoff of the option contract depends on the price of the underlying instrument at exercise; Asian options are thus one of the basic forms of exotic options.There are two types of Asian options, the Fixed Strike-where averaging price is used in place of underlying price, and Fixed Price-where averaging price is used in place of strike.
257	Investment	Arbitrage betting	100	Betting arbitrage is an example of arbitrage arising on betting markets due to either bookmakers' differing opinions on event outcomes or errors. When conditions allow, by placing one bet per each outcome with different betting companies, the bettor can make a profit regardless of the outcome.

In the bettors' slang an arbitrage is often referred to as an arb; people who use arbitrage are called arbers.

259	Investment	Alternative investment	122	An alternative investment or alternative investment fund (AIF) is an investment or fund that invests in asset classes other than stocks, bonds, and cash. The term is a relatively loose one and includes tangible assets such as precious metals, art, wine, antiques, coins, or stamps and some financial assets such as real estate, commodities, private equity, distressed securities, hedge funds, exchange funds, carbon credits, venture capital, film production, financial derivatives, and cryptocurrencies.

262	Investment	Alpha Profiling	209	Alpha profiling is an application of machine learning to optimize the execution of large orders in financial markets by means of algorithmic trading. The purpose is to select an execution schedule that minimizes the expected implementation shortfall, or more generally, ensures compliance with a best execution mandate.Alpha profiling models learn statistically-significant patterns in the execution of orders from a particular trading strategy or portfolio manager and leverages these patterns to associate an optimal execution schedule to new orders. In this sense, it is an application of statistical arbitrage to best execution. For example, a portfolio manager specialized in value investing may have a behavioral bias to place orders to buy while an asset is still declining in value. In this case a slow or back-loaded execution schedule would provide better execution results than an urgent one. But this same portfolio manager will occasionally place an order after the asset price has already begun to rise in which case it should best be handled with urgency; this example illustrates the fact that Alpha Profiling must combine public information such as market data with private information including as the identity of the portfolio manager and the size and origin of the order, to identify the optimal execution schedule.
263	Investment	Alpha (finance)	95	Alpha is a measure of the active return on an investment, the performance of that investment compared with a suitable market index. An alpha of 1% means the investment's return on investment over a selected period of time was 1% better than the market during that same period; a negative alpha means the investment underperformed the market. Alpha, along with beta, is one of two key coefficients in the capital asset pricing model used in modern portfolio theory and is closely related to other important quantities such as standard deviation, R-squared and the Sharpe ratio.
